# BlogHive

This project is a full-stack web development project that aims to create a modern and user-friendly blogging platform. The backend of the platform is built using Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma with a PostgreSQL database. This setup allows for efficient and scalable data management, with the ability to easily handle a large number of users and blogs. TypeScript is used for added type safety and improved code maintainability.

The frontend of the platform is built using Next.js, which allows for server-side rendering and a fast and smooth user experience. TailwindCSS and antd are used for styling, providing a clean and consistent look and feel.

Users can log in to the platform and create their own blogs using Markdown syntax. They can also view and interact with blogs written by other users on their own profile page and feed. The platform also includes a nested commenting system and a like system, allowing users to engage with and discover new content.

In summary, this project is a robust, feature-rich blogging platform that puts an emphasis on user experience, scalability and performance, and an easy to use system.
